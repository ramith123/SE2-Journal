This day was focused on researching about product backlog and how to create one and prioritize features. The group came together on a call to finalize individual research that have done on the topic and we created a moke-up of the product backlog.

I helped the team with listing out the features and identify some benefits for some of the features.
At the end we prioritize/ organized our features.

This session helped me to grasp a more detail understanding on how to choose and prioritize features for a product backlog and the importance of end-user involvement when creating a backlog.
