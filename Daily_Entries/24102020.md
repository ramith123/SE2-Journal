# Journal Entry

**Date**: `Tuesday 20 October to Saturday 24 October, 2020`

**Hours worked**: `5`

## Tasks Completed
- Had the retrospective/ Sprint review meetings
- Had the meeting for the beginning of the next Sprint meeting


## Summary
This week has been slow in terms of project progress due to other responsibilities. This was mostly about closing sprint 1 and discussing issues and concerns so we can improve for sprint 2. I managed to fix some errors that occurred when the client tries to communicate with the server and made my own task breakdown to be presented in the meeting.
